Some files are explicitly excluded and have their own license. These files are images that are used in the software. This exlusion is not allowed to be exploited, e.g. to enhance the features of this software and every image must be easily replacable by a person wanting to use this software, by just replacing the URL link for each image in an export created via the user interface of this software. The individual licenses for the images can be looked up in frontend/src/assets/image-sources.md. This path to the images can be changed in this file (LICENSE-README), if the structure of this software needs it, but must be included, as long as they are images.
We have decided to not have the license header in every file as this LICENSE-README file should be enough (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-howto.html.en) to make it clear that the whole software/program is under the chosen license. But if it will become necessary this option is possible. Still every file in this repository/folder und subfolders, are under the mentioned license, except the mentioned exluded images.
